# Corey-Relative-Permeability-Simulator

This interactive Python project visualizes relative permeability curves for water and oil phases using the Corey empirical model. It enables users to explore how changes in rock-fluid properties affect multiphase flow behavior in porous media — a core concept in reservoir engineering.

🔍 Overview:

The Corey model describes how relative permeability to oil and water changes with water saturation (Sw), accounting for residual saturations and fluid end-point permeabilities.

This tool uses ipywidgets to provide sliders for live parameter tuning and displays the resulting relative permeability curves (Krw and Kro) using matplotlib.

📌 Features

1. Interactive sliders for:

Swc: Connate water saturation

Sor: Residual oil saturation

Krw0 and Kro0: End-point relative permeabilities

nw and no: Corey exponents for water and oil

2. Dynamically generated relative permeability vs. water saturation plots

3. Clean, intuitive visualization using Jupyter notebook widgets
